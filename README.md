## 🏆 Hackathon Project

This project was developed for the [CodeCircuit.ai](https://www.codecircuit.ai/) hackathon, based on the prompt:

> "Periodic table with hover info and filter by properties."

The goal was to create an engaging, functional web application that makes exploring the periodic table fun and educational while demonstrating clean code and thoughtful UI/UX design.

## 🧪 Overview

This application provides a fun and engaging way to explore the chemical elements. With a cartoonish design and intuitive interface, it makes learning about the periodic table enjoyable for students, educators, and science enthusiasts.

## ✨ Features

- **Complete Periodic Table**: All 118 elements with accurate scientific data
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover over elements to view detailed information
- **Advanced Filtering System**: Filter elements by:
  - Category (Alkali Metals, Noble Gases, etc.)
  - Block (s, p, d, f)
  - Period (1-7)
  - Physical State (Solid, Liquid, Gas)
  - Natural vs. Synthetic Elements
  - Atomic Mass Range
  - Discovery Period (Ancient, Pre-1800, 1800s, 1900s, Modern Era)
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile landscape modes
- **Orientation Helper**: Smart detection prompts users to rotate to landscape mode on mobile
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically switches based on system preferences
